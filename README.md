------------------------

### Usage:

To create an umlaut, type the letter that needs it, followed by `.e`.
For example:

```
a.e  -> ä
U.e  -> Ü
```

It's also easy to create the `ß` character:

```
s.s  -> ß
```

You can undo a conversion by immediately hitting `Backspace`.


### Notes:

ÜberType works by simulating keyboard input, so it should work everywhere.
However, it's not guaranteed to do so, and you may run into the occasional
text field where it will not work. Still, I have tested it on several
versions of Windows, and I haven't yet run across a text field that didn't
accept ÜberType's input.
